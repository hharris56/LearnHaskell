# Learing Haskell

Decided I wanted to learn a FPL.

After reading some blog posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2mr7ks/im_debating_between_haskell_and_clojure_xpost/), [this](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/meditations-on-learning-haskell/), and [this](), I chose Haskell over the competition (mainly LISP and Clojure).

To learn Haskell I worked through the Spring 2013 section of CIS 194 that can be found [here](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/), based on recommendation from [this](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) github repo. For reference I checked my work against the solutions of one @/bshwb, their repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bschwb/cis194-solutions).

I also used [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) youtube series on learning Haskell coming from an imperitive programming background.
